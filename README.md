# chamka-python
a Python program to input for each employee, payroll number, grade, hours worked a month and distance in kilometres travelled a month for work and to determine and output for each employee, payroll number, gross pay, tax and net pay.
3.	Chamka has several employees. Write a Python program to input for each employee, payroll number, grade, hours worked a month and distance in kilometres travelled a month for work and to determine and output for each employee, payroll number, gross pay, tax and net pay.  Gross pay is the sum of basic pay, mileage and house allowance. Basic pay is the product of hours worked and wage rate. There are two grades of employees, X and Y. Normal wage rate is sh.1,300 per hour for Grade X but sh. 1,600 per hour for Grade Y. Mileage is paid at the rate of sh. 75 per kilometre to Grade X employees. Grade Y is paid mileage of sh. 117 per kilometre subject to a maximum of mileage of sh. 30,000. House allowance is sh. 20,000 per month for Grade Y.  Grade X employee gets no house allowance. Employees are taxed at the rate of 15% of gross pay for gross pay over and above sh. 50,000.  Otherwise there would be no tax. Net pay is gross pay less tax.	The program should use a function in determining taxes.
